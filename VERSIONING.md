# Versioning and Source Control

## Version Control System
This project uses **Git** for version control. Git enables collaborative development, robust change tracking, and safe experimentation with new features. All code changes, bug fixes, and enhancements are tracked through commits, branches, and pull requests.

## GitHub Repository
The project is hosted on **GitHub**, which provides a cloud-based platform for code hosting, collaboration, and review. GitHub is used for:
- Storing the main codebase and all project history
- Managing issues, feature requests, and bug reports
- Code reviews via pull requests
- Continuous integration and deployment workflows

**Repository Link:**
[https://github.com/your-org/your-repo](https://github.com/your-org/your-repo)

> Replace the above link with your actual repository URL if different.

## Workflow
- Developers clone the repository using `git clone`.
- Feature development and bug fixes are done in separate branches.
- Changes are committed with descriptive messages and pushed to GitHub.
- Pull requests are created for code review and discussion before merging into the main branch.
- All project history is preserved, allowing easy rollback and auditing of changes.

## Benefits
- **Traceability:** Every change is tracked and attributed.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work in parallel.
- **Backup:** The codebase is safely stored in the cloud.
- **Transparency:** All project activity is visible to contributors and stakeholders.
