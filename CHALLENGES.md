# CHALLENGES.md

## Summary of Achievements
- Implemented robust data import/export for water sources and infrastructure assets, supporting both CSV and PDF/OCR formats.
- Added accessible and user-friendly modals for single and bulk data addition.
- Ensured all data changes are reflected in tables, charts, and export features in real time.
- Improved UI/UX and accessibility across forms, modals, and tables.
- Added a citizen-facing report submission section to the landing page.
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback throughout the application.
- Maintained up-to-date documentation (VERSIONING.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, TEST_CASES.md).

## Limitations
- OCR accuracy for PDF imports may vary depending on document quality and layout.
- Bulk imports rely on correct data formatting; malformed files may still require manual correction.
- Some advanced accessibility features (e.g., full screen reader support) may need further refinement.
- Real-time collaboration or multi-user editing is not currently supported.
- Localization is limited; the app is primarily in English and may not fully support all local languages or dialects.

## Unsuccessful Attempts
- Full automation of data validation for all import types was not achieved; some manual review is still necessary.
- Integration with external GIS or mapping services was explored but not completed due to time and resource constraints.
- Attempts to implement push notifications for citizen reports were not successful in this release.

## Challenges Faced During Implementation of WaterNet Cameroon

This document outlines the key technical, design, and organizational challenges encountered during the development of the WaterNet Cameroon water resource management system.

---

### 1. Data Import/Export Robustness
- **CSV/PDF Import Complexity:** Supporting both CSV and PDF (OCR) imports for tables required careful handling of file parsing, error states, and user feedback. Ensuring data integrity and mapping imported fields to internal models was non-trivial, especially with inconsistent or incomplete data.
- **Data Propagation:** Ensuring that imported or newly added data (via modals or bulk upload) immediately updated all relevant tables, charts, and export features required a well-structured state management approach.

### 2. User Interaction & Modals
- **Modal Management:** Integrating multiple modals (for single entry, CSV import, PDF/OCR import) in a user-friendly and accessible way, while preventing UI conflicts, was challenging.
- **Form Validation:** Providing robust validation and error feedback for all forms (including citizen reports, asset/source addition, and meter readings) was essential for data quality and user trust.

### 3. Accessibility & UX
- **Accessible Forms:** Ensuring all form elements (labels, selects, buttons) were accessible (e.g., proper `title` attributes, keyboard navigation) required extra attention, especially with custom UI components.
- **Responsive Design:** Maintaining a visually appealing and functional UI across devices and screen sizes, while using Tailwind CSS utility classes, involved iterative testing and adjustments.

### 4. State Synchronization
- **Live Data Updates:** Guaranteeing that all visualizations, exports, and tables reflected the latest data (from both manual and bulk entry) required careful state lifting and prop drilling, especially in larger components.
- **Error Handling:** Handling edge cases (e.g., failed file uploads, invalid data, network issues) and providing clear user feedback was a recurring challenge.

### 5. Documentation & Maintainability
- **Keeping Docs in Sync:** As features evolved, keeping documentation (including deployment, versioning, and test cases) up-to-date was a continuous effort.
- **Code Organization:** Balancing between rapid prototyping and maintainable, modular code structure (especially for shared components/utilities) was sometimes difficult under time constraints.

### 6. Technical Constraints
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Integrating and customizing third-party libraries (for CSV parsing, OCR, charts) sometimes led to compatibility or performance issues.
- **TypeScript Strictness:** Ensuring type safety while rapidly iterating on features occasionally slowed development, but ultimately improved reliability.

### 7. Stakeholder Requirements
- **Evolving Requirements:** Adapting to changing or expanding requirements (e.g., new data fields, additional user roles, new import/export formats) required flexibility in both design and implementation.
- **Localization & Context:** Designing for Cameroon's specific context (e.g., localities, infrastructure types, user roles) required ongoing research and stakeholder feedback.

---

## Lessons Learned
- Early investment in state management and modular component design pays off as the app grows.
- Accessibility and error handling should be considered from the start, not as afterthoughts.
- Continuous documentation and clear communication with stakeholders are key to project success.
